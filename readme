This project is my version of creating a shopping cart. There are a number of areas where I've added creativity, but more importantly, solid functionality. First, for best practice in the Item and ItemOrder classes, I used private get and set methods, which allows for secure data transfer. Secondly, I provided a bulk discount option with a special "Three for Two" offer. Thirdly, within my GUI, I added a try-catch block for entering invalid symbols for the name and price. Lastly, I used a titled border to make everything look good.
